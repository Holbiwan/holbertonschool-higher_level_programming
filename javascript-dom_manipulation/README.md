# JavaScript DOM manipulation

![JS Dom](https://zupimages.net/up/24/05/vrao.png)

## Description

JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation refers to the process of dynamically interacting with the structure, content, and style of a web page using JavaScript.
The DOM represents the hierarchical structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure, with each element, attribute, and piece of text as nodes.

DOM manipulation allows developers to programmatically access, modify, or manipulate the elements and content of a web page in real-time. This enables the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications. Common tasks performed through DOM manipulation include:

* Accessing Elements: JavaScript can be used to select and retrieve HTML elements from the DOM using various methods such as getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, and more.

* Modifying Content: Developers can update or change the content of HTML elements, including text, attributes, or even the structure of the document.

* Adding or Removing Elements: New elements can be added to the document or existing ones can be removed. This is crucial for creating dynamic user interfaces.

* Manipulating Styles: The style of HTML elements can be modified dynamically, allowing developers to change the appearance of elements based on user interactions or other events.

* Enabling the execution of specific actions in response to user interactions (e.g., clicks, key presses).
